PDF Toaster
=====

A simple-as-possible gui for compressing pdf files using ghostscript on macOS. Made with Applescript.

Compress those huge pdf files away! Minimal command line work is needed to setup and then compressing one or multiple pdf's is one click away.

## Setup:

- Open Terminal.app
- Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh). Just copy/paste the long command found on homebrew's homepage.
- Install ghostscript:
 
```
$ brew install ghostscript
```
- [Download PDF Toaster](https://github.com/zdol/pdf-toaster/archive/master.zip), run it and follow the onscreen instructions. Best way to use it, is to press `âŒ˜Command` and drag the app to the Finder toolbar (or drag to the dock) and use it as a droplet.
