PDF Toaster
=====

A simple-as-possible Ghostscript GUI for compressing pdf files, made with Applescript.

Best way to compress those huge pdf files on macOS! Minimal command line work is needed to setup and then compressing one or multiple pdf's is one click away.

## Setup:

- Open Terminal.app
- Install [homebrew](https://brew.sh). Just copy/paste this long command found on homebrew's page.
- Install ghostscript:
> 
```
$ brew install ghostscript
```
- Download PDF Toaster, run it and follow the onscreen instructions. Best way to use it, is to press Command, drag the app to the Finder toolbar and use it as a droplet.
